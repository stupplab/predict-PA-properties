num_hbonds_per_residue - 1(>0.3) 0(<=0.3)  | 75%
r_O_H - 1(top 50%) 0(bottom 50%) for now   | 83%
hbond_projection_to_mean (Degree-Of-Alignment (DOA)) - 1(top 50%) 0(bottom 50%) for now | ~65% accuracy
C16_C_flatness (flatness) - 1(top 50%) 0(bottom 50%) for now | 76% accuracy
RMSF - 1(top 50%) 0(bottom 50%) for now | ~50% accurancy

Most reliable are num_hbonds_per_residue, r_O_H, and probably C16_C_flatness a little bit

The ML models will be used for filtering candidate sequences from the potential fiber sequences generated by the CG ML model. This process is to be done inside `handle_data.py`
But before this, I need to make trained ML model as a usable executable. This can be done using the python script itself and all the important classes inside.

Run the CG and atomistic simulaitons of the PA_candidates_seqs5.
